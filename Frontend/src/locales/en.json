        "title": "Learning to code like a language",
        "excerpt": "Pattern recognition, immersion and the unexpected parallels between JavaScript and spoken Italian in Rome.",
        "reflection": "Last summer I spent three weeks in Rome. Not in a classroom, but in markets, cafés and alleyways: learning Italian the way you do when you have no choice but to speak it. At first every sentence sounded clumsy. Then, little by little, patterns emerged. The rhythm of asking for directions. The cadence of ordering a coffee. The small victories when you were understood and understood others.\n\nLearning to code felt very similar.\n\nWhen I started with JavaScript, I tried to memorise syntax. I read the docs like a manual. But real fluency came when I stopped \"translating\" in my head and started thinking in code. When I stopped asking \"how do you say this?\" and started recognising patterns I had already seen.\n\nIn Rome I learned that prepositions change meaning with context. \"A Roma\" is \"in Rome\", \"di Roma\" is \"from Rome\". Subtle but decisive. In React I learned that props and state both hold data, but context determines how you use them. It's not about memorising rules, but developing intuition through repetition.\n\nThe best language teachers don't stop at grammar tables. They immerse you in conversation, let you make mistakes, correct with care. The best way I learned React wasn't tutorials, but building messy prototypes, breaking things and slowly understanding why they broke.\n\nThere's a moment, when you learn a language, when you stop translating. You hear \"buongiorno\" and you know it's morning, you know it's a greeting, you feel the warmth of the word without thinking. That's when you're fluent.\n\nThe same happens with code. One day you look at a component and see its structure. You know where state lives, how data flows, what breaks when you change something. You're no longer reading English words: you're reading logic, rhythm, intent.\n\nI still struggle with the subjunctive in Italian. I still get confused with advanced TypeScript generics. But the process is the same: immersion, pattern recognition, mistakes and trying again. Both require being comfortable not knowing, seeming clumsy, asking for help.\n\nThe developers I admire most aren't the ones who memorised every API. They're the ones who learned to think in systems, to recognise patterns across languages, to adapt what they know to new contexts. Like the best travellers aren't the ones who memorise phrase books: they're the ones who listen, adapt and stay curious.\n\nEvery language—spoken or programming—is a tool to connect. To express ideas, build things, collaborate. And like every language, it gets easier the more you use it in real contexts, not in books.\n\nIf you're learning to code and feel lost, remember: you're not memorising a dictionary. You're learning to have a conversation. Be patient. Make mistakes. Keep building. One day you'll realise you're thinking in code without even noticing.\n\nLike one day, in a small café in Trastevere, I ordered a coffee in Italian without thinking about it.",

        "title": "The café test",
        "excerpt": "Why I judge my work by whether I'd use it in a noisy café, with spotty wifi and a dying battery.",
        "reflection": "I do my best thinking in cafés. Not in trendy co-working spaces or quiet libraries, but in real, imperfect cafés: hissing espresso machines, baristas shouting orders, wifi that comes and goes, laptop battery always at 12%.\n\nThese places have taught me more about software development than any course.\n\nBecause the café is the worst environment to use an app—and therefore the best to test it. If it works there, it works anywhere.\n\nSlow wifi? Your users have it. Dying battery? Sure. Connection dropping every three minutes? Always. Dirty screen you can't see in the sun? Every day.\n\nI was in a café in Lisbon, trying to book a train ticket on my phone. The app kept timing out. Every attempt meant re-entering payment details. The page loaded slowly. Images were huge. The UI assumed a perfect connection and infinite patience. I gave up and walked to the station.\n\nThat moment changed how I build things.\n\nNow, when I'm deep in development, comfortable at my desk with a big monitor and ethernet, I force myself to ask: would this work in a café?\n\nDoes it load fast enough on 3G? Does it cache when the connection drops? Can you see the buttons in bright sun? Does it drain the battery with constant API calls? Does it respect people with limited data?\n\nThe café test isn't just about performance: it's about respect. Respect for people's time, context and limits. It's designing for real people in real situations, not ideal users in perfect conditions.\n\nThe most thoughtful apps I've used were made by people who get this. They load quickly. They work offline. They save progress. They don't make you start over when the connection drops. They feel built by people who live in the real world.\n\nI've been in cafés in Tokyo with a socket at every seat. In cafés in rural Portugal with the wifi password written on cardboard. In cafés in New York where you compete with fifty others for bandwidth.\n\nEach taught me something about building software that works for everyone, not just those with the latest MacBook and fibre.\n\nThe best part of the café test is that it forces you to prioritise. When you can't load everything at once, you learn what really matters. When you can't show ten HD images, you get creative with what needs to be communicated. With the battery dying, you learn which features are essential and which are optional.\n\nConstraints breed creativity. Cafés are full of constraints.\n\nNext time you build something, try it in a café. Not the fancy one with perfect wifi: the chaotic one where everything's a bit broken, a bit unreliable, a bit imperfect.\n\nBecause that's where your users are. It's the real world. And if it works there, you've built something worth using.\n\nNow excuse me: the laptop is at 8% and I need to find a socket.",

        "title": "Slowing down to go faster",
        "excerpt": "What a week in the Japanese countryside taught me about patient problem-solving and the value of deliberate thinking.",
        "reflection": "Last autumn I spent a week in the Japanese countryside, in a traditional ryokan near Takayama. No deadlines, Slack notifications or pull requests to review. Just mountains, wooden architecture that has stood for 400 years and time to think.\n\nOne morning I watched the owner prepare breakfast. Every gesture was intentional. He wasn't rushing. He wasn't slow either: he was precise. He knew exactly what he was doing and did it with full attention.\n\nI realised I had forgotten how to work like that.\n\nSomewhere along the way I had internalised that \"going fast\" meant writing fast, deciding fast, shipping fast. That speed was a virtue in itself. That the developer who pushes code fastest is the best.\n\nBut watching that breakfast—seeing something complex become simple through patient, practised attention—I understood something different.\n\nSpeed comes from clarity. And clarity requires slowing down.\n\nWhen I got home I changed how I approach problems. Before diving into code, I take time to really understand what I'm trying to solve. I sketch on paper. I step back and reflect. I ask questions I used to skip because I was too eager to build.\n\nAt first it feels slower. But I've found it's actually faster: I don't constantly have to go back, rewrite or realise halfway that I'm solving the wrong problem.\n\nThere's a Japanese concept called \"ma\": the space between things, the pause, the silence. Not empty, but intentional space that gives meaning to what surrounds it. In music it's the rest between notes. In architecture it's the empty space that makes a room calm.\n\nIn development it's the time for thought before the time for code. Planning before building. The space to ask \"why?\" before \"how?\".\n\nI used to feel guilty for this time. As if not actively typing meant not producing. But some of my best results have come from moments when I wasn't even at the keyboard—when walking, cooking or staring out the window, giving my mind time to work on a problem without forcing it.\n\nThe pressure to go fast is real. Deadlines exist. Stakeholders want results. But I've learned that going fast without direction just means arriving sooner at the wrong destination.\n\nThe developers I respect most aren't the ones who churn out code fastest. They're the ones who understand the problem deeply before solving it. Who ask clarifying questions that slow the initial conversation but save hours later. Who say \"let me think about it\" instead of \"done by tonight\".\n\nThere's a difference between being reflective and being slow. Between being thorough and being indecisive. The best work happens where speed and intention meet: moving with purpose toward a clear goal.\n\nIn that ryokan there was a small rock garden outside my window. Fifteen stones arranged on raked gravel. It looked simple. I learned the designer had taken six months to place those stones correctly. Not because he was slow, but because he was deliberate. Because he knew that some things can't be rushed without losing what makes them meaningful.\n\nI'm not saying spend six months on every component. I'm saying that sometimes the fastest way is to stop, think clearly and then move with intention.\n\nThat breakfast in the ryokan was the best meal I had in Japan. Not because it was complicated, but because every element was considered. Nothing rushed. Nothing wasted. Just quiet excellence born from patience and attention.\n\nThat's the kind of code I want to write. The kind of developer I want to become.\n\nNot the fastest. Just the most thoughtful. And in time that will be fast enough.",
